## 🏁 Getting Started

To get started with Exzly, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/agoenks29D/exzly.git
   ```

2. Duplicate the example `.env` file to create your configuration file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   For a detailed explanation of environment variables, refer to [Environment Setup](https://github.com/agoenks29D/exzly/wiki#️-project-environment).

3. Run the following command to install the required packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Configure the database settings in the [`/database/config.json`](/database/config.json) file according to your environment.

5. Before starting the application, you need to set up the database. You can choose between demo data (for development) or production-ready setup. See more options in the [Migration and Seeder](#-migration-and-seeder) section.

6. Now, you're ready to run the app! refer to the 👉 [Running the Project](#-running-the-project) section.

### Security Settings

Modify the security configurations in the [`/src/config/security.js`](/src/config/security.js) file.

## 🌱 Migration and Seeder

Handle database migrations and seeders as follows:

- **Run all migrations and seeders for development:**

  ```bash
  npm run db:demo
  ```

- **Run all migrations and seeders for production:**

  ```bash
  npm run db:start
  ```

  This command ensures no fake data is generated.

- **Run all migration files:**

  ```bash
  npx sequelize-cli db:migrate --name all.js
  ```

- **Run a specific migration:**

  ```bash
  npx sequelize-cli db:migrate --name base.js
  ```

- **Run specific seeders:**

  - Start seeder (used for production, no fake data):

    ```bash
    npx sequelize-cli db:seed --seed start
    ```

  - Demo seeder (includes fake data for testing purposes):

    ```bash
    npx sequelize-cli db:seed --seed demo
    ```

## 🧹 Linter and Formatter

Keep your code clean and consistent by using the following commands:

- **Run linter:**

  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```

- **Run formatter:**

  ```bash
  npm run format
  ```

## 🚀 Running the Project

Run the project in the desired mode:

- **Production mode:**

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

- **Development mode:**

  ```bash
  npm run start:dev
  ```

## 🧪 Running Tests

Exzly comes with an integrated testing environment using Jest. This setup is ready out of the box and supports both unit and API tests.

Run all tests:

```bash
npm test
```

Run a specific test suite:

```bash
npm test -- <test_suite_name>
```

To prepare the database specifically for the test environment, run the following command:

```bash
npm run db:test
```

Run test coverage:

```bash
npm run test:cov
```
